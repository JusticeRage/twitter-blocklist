# twitter-blocklist
A crowdsourced list of undesirable Twitter accounts

For a while now, I've been blocking the authors of every sponsored tweet which appears in my timeline. A recent discussion with friends revealed interest in sharing and crowdsourcing that list, which is why this repository was created.

This list only contains accounts who generate advertising on Twitter. Pull requests to add additional ones are very welcome, but people will not be added to the blocklist only because they are annoying. New submitters are encouraged so submit screenshots of sponsored tweets in the pull request to speed up the vetting process.

## How to use
Simply go to your list of [blocked accounts](https://twitter.com/settings/blocked) on Twitter and click "Advanced options" to import the list contained in this repository.
